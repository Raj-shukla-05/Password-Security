## 🛡 Concepts & Best Practices

### 🔸 What Makes a Password Strong?
- Use at least 12 characters
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid personal info like names or birthdates
- Do not use dictionary words or common patterns

### 🔸 Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack**: Attempts every possible combination
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses precompiled lists of common words and passwords

### 🔸 Why Password Length Matters
- The longer the password, the harder it is to crack
- 16+ characters is highly recommended

### 🔸 What is a Passphrase?
- A series of unrelated words like `Purple$Tiger!Rides7Moon`
- Easier to remember but highly secure

### 🔸 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Adds a second verification layer (e.g., OTP, biometrics)
- Reduces impact of stolen passwords

### 🔸 Password Managers
- Securely store unique passwords
- Auto-fill and generate strong passwords

### 🔸 Common Mistakes in Password Creation
- Using predictable words or patterns
- Reusing the same password across multiple accounts
- Including personal info like pet names or birthdays

## ✅ Conclusion:
A strong password is your first line of defense. Use passphrases, enable MFA, and rely on password managers for better digital security.
